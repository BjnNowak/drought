# Little Picture 2023

This directory contains my submission for [the ESA "Little Picture" 2023](https://climate.esa.int/en/littlepicturescompetition/) data visualisation competition. The map below shows **all areas affected by drought in 2022**.

The map was created with R (code [here](https://github.com/BjnNowak/drought/blob/main/script/little_picture_drought.R)) and the layout was finalized with Figma to resemble the previous visualizations. the data used here come from [the Combined Drought Indicator from Copernicus](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/gdo/php/index.php?id=2112).
